# node-lcms

A little wrapper over [LittleCMS](https://github.com/mm2/Little-CMS) utilities.

## Installation

You need to have LittleCMS installed. You can build it from source by following these steps (which should work on Unix-based systems, including macOS):

```bash
git clone git@github.com:mm2/Little-CMS.git
cd Little-CMS
./configure
make
make check
make install
```

You can now use `node-lcms` in your project by installing it from npm into your project:

```bash
# using npm
npm install node-lcms

# using yarn
yarn add node-lcms
```

## API reference

### `convert(options = {})` â†’ `function(color_arr)`

This is a wrapper over the Little CMS's `transicc` utility, which converts colors based on ICC profiles.

```js
let { convert } = require('node-lcms');

let conv = convert({
	profile_out: require.resolve('color-profiles/pso-coated-v3.icc')
});

console.log(conv([255, 0, 0]));
```
